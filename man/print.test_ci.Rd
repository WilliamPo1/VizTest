\title{Print Method for test_ci Objects}
\usage{
\method{print}{test_ci}(x, ..., best = TRUE, missed_tests = TRUE, level = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{test_ci}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments, currently not implemented.}

\item{best}{Logical indicating whether the results should be filtered to include only the best level(s) or include all levels}

\item{missed_tests}{Logical indicating whether the tests not represented by the optimal visual testing intervals should be displayed}

\item{level}{Which level should be used as the optimal one.  If \code{NULL}, the easiest optimal level will be used.  Easiness is measured by the sum of the overlap
in confidence intervals for insignificant tests plus the distance between the lower and upper bound for tests that are significant.}
