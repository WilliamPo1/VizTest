\arguments{
\item{obj}{A model object (or any object) where \code{coef()} and \code{vcov()} return estimates of coefficients and sampling variability.}

\item{test_level}{The type I error rate of the pairwise tests.}

\item{range_levels}{The range of confidence levels to try.}

\item{level_increment}{Step size of increase between the values of \code{range_levels}.}

\item{adjust}{Multiplicity adjustment to use when calculating the p-values for the pairwise tests.}

\item{include_intercept}{Logical indicating whether the intercept should be included in the tests, defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{include_zero}{Should univariate tests at zero be included, defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{easy_thresh}{Proportion of distance between the biggest upper bound and the smallest lower bound to use
as the threshold in the calculation of "easiness".}

\item{...}{Other arguments, currently not implemented.}
